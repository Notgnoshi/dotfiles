# TODO

* [ ] SSH
    * [ ] config (hardcode config file, or use a template? Is it possible to use includes?)
    * [ ] keygen
* [X] Cargo helpers
* [X] Make it also work on Ubuntu? (s/dnf/apt/, but also some packages have different names)
* [X] gdb-multiarch -- default gdb is multiarch
* [X] docker on Fedora 38
* [X] vim with +clipboard feature -- vim-X11 provides gvim, which can be run from the terminal
